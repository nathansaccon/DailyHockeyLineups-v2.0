Value players are players that are likely to receive more fantasy points than other players that cost that same amount. Keep this in mind when adding these players to your lineup. Value players are not usually players that you should build your lineups around, however they will always leave more room in your lineup for premium players. If you're looking for a longer list of value players, check out the [cheat sheet][1]. Make sure to check that a player is in the starting lineup before adding them to your lineup.
